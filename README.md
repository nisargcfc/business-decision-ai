## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn
- Anthropic API key (optional - works with fallback data)

### ⚠️ Fixing Vercel Deployment Issues (401 & 404 Errors)

If you're experiencing:
- `401 Unauthorized` errors for manifest.json
- `404 Not Found` errors for /api/claude

**Solution:**
1. **Update vercel.json** - Already done with proper build configuration
2. **Set Environment Variable in Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings in Vercel
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` with your actual API key
   - Ensure it's enabled for all environments
3. **Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod --force
   ```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/business-decision-ai.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd business-decision-ai

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The app works without an API key using fallback data for demonstration purposes.
